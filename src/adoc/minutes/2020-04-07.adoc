== Jakarta EE 9

Anything the PMC can contribute with?
GlassFish blocked on several upstream EE4J implementation projects. 
Jersey will maybe have something next week. Tyrus is on the way.

The PMC could help by encouraging milestone releases as soon as possible in the Jakarta staging repository. Send an email to project leads mailing list. Steve will send the email.
