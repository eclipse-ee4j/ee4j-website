== PMC Quality Control Statement to the Community

How do we handle projects that do not want to follow these guidelines? Is there support in EDP to enforce?
The PMC can step in and review when a project wants to do a release.

Project describe the release etc.

The PMC _can_ require e.g. TCK must pass.

Can require rules to be followed in order to be able to participate in the project.

Release review is where these checks are normally done.

. Publish the rules
. Set up restrictions on branches in github
