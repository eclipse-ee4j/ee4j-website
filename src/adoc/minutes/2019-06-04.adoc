Discussed if API, spec and TCK sources should be in the same repository.

The PMC recommends to keep the API and spec sources in the same repository but leaves the decision to the projects.
The TCK is up to the project to decide, but the projects should be aware of the potential.

=== Scope Statements

Scope statements for the API projects must be produced in order to be able to convert them into Specification Projects.

.Tracking
https://github.com/orgs/eclipse-ee4j/projects/10

We need to create statements for the projects that are missing.

.Action for all:
Complete the missing statements or nudge issues, move to ongoing.

Wayne will present 2-3 projects for restructuring to the spec committee and email status on the PMC mailing list.

=== Specification Names

Specifications (and the specification projects) must be renamed in order to be converted into Specification Projects.

.Action
Update GitHub issue status - all

Write a suggested name and state that this will be chosen the 7th.

== Jakarta EE 8 Release Schedule

Dmitry presented the proposed release schedule.
The goal is to deliver Jakarta EE 8 before Oracle Code One.
Everything need to be completed and ready for release review by August 5 in order to meet this goal.
_Placeholder specification documents_ will be used in the cases we havenâ€™t received the specifications from Oracle yet, or time does not allow for updating the documents in order to meet the deadline.
The PMC will ask the Steering committee to ask the EF to set up Nexus Pro to allow for TCK artifacts to live longer than the default 1 month.
Dmitry will present the schedule to the Steering Committee.

== Jakarta EE Platform Team Meetings

Leave this to the project leads to decide.

== Frequency of PMC meetings

Change to weekly meetings the following couple of weeks. Tanja will update the calendar.

== Next Meeting
