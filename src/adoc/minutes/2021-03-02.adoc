== Activity in the projects

Discussed how we, as the PMC, can encourage projects to be more active. 
Can we use the Jakarta EE Ambassadors more actively? 
A possible action is to create a GitHub issue in the specification projects’ issue tracker asking for a plan. 
The deadline communicated from the platform project is that plan reviews for the next Jakarta EE release are due **April 15, 2021**.
