= EE4J PMC Meeting #2020-07

== General

Date: 2020-07-07

Present:

* Kevin Sutter (IBM)
* Ivar Grimstad (Eclipse Foundation)
* Ed Bratt (Oracle)
* Dmitry Kornilov (Oracle)
* Steve Millidge (Payara)

== Quorum and Membership Discussion

* Should Wayne be replaced by Ivar to represent Eclipse? Moving Wayne to a mentorship role?
* Is the PMI page accurate for PMC Leadership, Members, and Committers?
* Are we missing some stakeholders?  It seems a little light. We should offer more membership and participation across all of the EE4J projects. Should be more development focused (vs vendor focused).
* EE4J PMC Role Definition:  https://jakarta.ee/documents/committees/primer-on-committee-responsibilities.pdf 

.Actions:
* Clear out Wayne’s status - Ivar
* Shouldn’t Kenji be listed a committer as well? - Ivar

== Jakarta NoSQL

The project is due for a progress review according to the EFSP. Here is a progress report the project has provided: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gg43hojQ5pgWU0sfeGSm3noFszAo7NNX0u6hRorx8HA/edit

The PMC encourages the project to broaden the community and participation. Creating a specification with only a few committers may limit the number of interested to implement it. Suggest that project lead reach out to potential committers. Check with the Ambassadors or the Adopt-a-Spec program. Get traction on the Eclipse JNoSQL and drive adoption and interest in the specification from it. 

Ivar will provide a response to Jakarta NoSQL project lead.
