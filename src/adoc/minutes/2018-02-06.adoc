Present:

* Kevin
* Wayne
* Steve
* David
* Dmitry
* Ivar

== Project Proposals Status
How to handle the initial committers of old specs. Companies that does not exist anymore etc.
We should only add people that have been active lately.

List all eg members? Or only eg members that wants to.
Eclipse would prefer to not include people that are not aware of that they are being added.
Old java.net mailing lists for inactive old specs not anymore available due to java.net shutdown.
Want to avoid any perception of vendor bias.

*Newer specs:*

Mail on the EG lists if there are any lists active. Ask for confirmation to be added to the initial committer list.

*Old specs:*

Send out to ee4j-community list? If you are an eg member and want to contribute, let us know.

For non-active projects, such as JSTL, a short list of initial committers is needed. If someone from the EG or elsewhere shows up later, they can be added then.

*Decision:*

. Post proposals
. Mail on community list
. Rule-of-thumb is that everybody that have been on the EG will be added if they want by adding comments on the proposals.
. When we are in a state that we can accept contributions, committers may be added the usual Eclipse way.

== EE4J Blog
Is there any place where people can blog EE4J articles?
Wayne suggests to set up an aggregator to pull stuff from peopleâ€™s own blogs

== Brand Name
The review process has distilled the list of names down to 2 items:

* Jakarta
* Enterprise Profile

Wayne will set up a Google Form for the vote and send out for review on the private list.
The PMC should be active on private blogs and state opinions on twitter, blogs etc.

== Quality Control Statement to the Community
Give it another week so we are ready

== PMC Agenda Items
Ivar will prepare a list for next meeting.

Tabled for next meeting.

== PMC Meeting Frequency
